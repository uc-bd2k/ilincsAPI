This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
require(httr)
require(jsonlite)
# Assuming this file is created in the previous step
sigFile <- "completeSig_Thu_Nov_29_13_21_06_2018_15725.xls"
 
myurl <- "http://www.ilincs.org/api/ilincsR/findConcordances"
res <- content(POST(myurl, body = list(file=sigFile, lib="LIB_6", path="/mnt/raid/tmp/"), encode = "form"))
output <- data.table::rbindlist(res$concordanceTable, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
output <- output[,c("signatureid", "perturbagenID", "treatment", "cellline", "time", "similarity", "pValue", "nGenes")]
head(output)
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
