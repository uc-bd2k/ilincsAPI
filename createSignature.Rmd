This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
require(httr)
require(jsonlite)
# This is the general pipeline

myurl <- "http://www.ilincs.org/api/ilincsR/LincsDataAnalysis"

res <- content(POST(myurl, body = list(exp="EDS-1014", prop="ER", filterchk="ER:+,,,ER:-", includeORexclude=1), encode = "form"))

signature <- data.table::rbindlist(res$signature, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)
head(signature)
sigFile <- paste0("completeSig_", res$sessionID, ".xls")
cat("\n\n signature file is:" , sigFile, "\n")


cat("\n", "Information retrievable for this signature", "\n")
names(res)

```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
